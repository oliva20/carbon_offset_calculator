We need an object (Coordinate) that represents a geopoint. 
 -> We also need a object (Route) that keeps the geopoints together 
 -> Inside this object there should be functionality to calculate the distance between the geopoints. 
 -> Create a RouteDAO  
 -> This will be implemented using a geotools library.
